How to start the Hermes program:
1.Install a local mysql server on you database (it will work with an external, only we havenÂ´t
had the budget to make one)
2.make a path to your mysql server so you can call on it with mysql.
3. run the command bash reset_local.bash, while standing in the folder it lays(sql-real-database), this will setup the
database
4. compile the files and run it, alternatively you can open it in eclipse and run it directly.
